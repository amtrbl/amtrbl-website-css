            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p> I'm a big fan of coffee and a huge "old" music & film aficionado. Music - especially - has shaped me into the person I am today. It truly can change how you view life. Apart from some other trivial interests such as reading, travelling and learning new languages, I have become extremely invested in art of programming & developing. Learning how to code has always been a secret wish of mine, which I never pursued due to several reasons but mostly because of negative thinking and uncertainty. Now I am confident in myself and my abilities. I am a firm believer in doing what YOU want, it is YOUR life and if you have any dreams... what's stopping you? We have only this one life on Earth after all.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>I have a degree in Business Administration with a specialisation in Business Information Systems and Operations Management, which isn't bad and has helped me get a Business Analytics Position at a global company. The only problem is that it doesn't offer any fulfillment and isn't fun. I feel the need to create something and enjoy what I do for work. This is how I got to self learning Front- & Backend Web Development, to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
